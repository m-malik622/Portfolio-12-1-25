  title: "LSU Softball Strike Zone Prediction Model",
  year: "2025",
  summary:
    "A machine learning project that models umpire strike-zone decisions for LSU Softball using real pitch-tracking data. The system predicts the probability of a called strike based on pitch location, batter/pitcher handedness, and swing behavior. Built using neural-network transfer learning, model surgery, and custom visualization tools to generate detailed strike-zone heatmaps.",

    "PyTorch",
    "Neural Networks",
    "Python",
    "NumPy",
    "Matplotlib",
    "ML Engineering"
  ],
  details: [
    "Developed a custom MLP architecture that predicts called-strike probability using vertical location, horizontal location, swing status, and handedness inputs.",
    "Implemented weight-surgery transfer learning to expand a small initial model into a more complex 5-feature architecture without losing previously-learned MLB behavior.",
    "Trained and fine-tuned the upgraded model on LSU Softball data to capture umpire-specific strike-zone tendencies.",
    "Created heatmap generators that visualize strike probabilities under all combinations of batter/pitcher handedness and swing behavior.",
    "Added support for overlaying official softball rulebook strike-zone boundaries for comparison against real umpire behavior.",
  ],
  highlights: [
    "Neural Network Weight Surgery",
    "Strike-Zone Heatmaps",
    "Feature Expansion (x, y, swing, pitcher hand, batter hand)",
    "LSU Softball Fine-Tuning",
    "Umpire Behavior Modeling"
  ],
  userExperience: [
    "Analysts can visualize 2D probability maps showing how likely an umpire is to call a strike at any location.",
    "Heatmaps automatically adapt to context: batter handedness, pitcher handedness, and whether the batter swings.",
    "The model reveals expansions/shrinkages in the zone compared to the rulebook, assisting scouting and decision-making.",
    "Coaches and researchers can compare different scenarios (LHP vs RHB, swing vs take) through clear visual outputs.",
    "Umpire tendencies are modeled probabilistically rather than through fixed rules, capturing real-world decision patterns."
